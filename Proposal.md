For this gallery we need three pages:
1. List of photos
2. Add new photo
3. Delete photo

Also we need store our data into a single database:

CREATE TABLE Gallery(
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Type VARCHAR(100),
    Size INT,
    Width INT,
    HEIGHT INT,
    UploadTime TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
